## Introduction

AI Inventory Management is a smart inventory tracking system that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize stock management and reduce waste. This project aims to help businesses maintain optimal inventory levels, forecast demand, and automate reorder processes, ensuring that products are always available when needed.

## Features

- **Real-time Inventory Tracking**: Monitor stock levels in real-time and receive alerts for low inventory.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Use AI algorithms to predict future inventory needs based on historical data.
- **Automated Reordering**: Automatically generate purchase orders when stock falls below predefined thresholds.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive dashboard for easy navigation and management of inventory.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports on inventory performance and trends.
- **Multi-Location Support**: Manage inventory across multiple locations seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **Framework**: React
  - **Build Tool**: Vite
  - **Language**: TypeScript
  
- **Backend**: 
  - **Framework**: Flask
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - **AI/ML Libraries**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation

To get started with the AI Inventory Management system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GopiPrajapath/ai-inventory-management.git
   cd ai-inventory-management
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection settings in the `.env` file.

5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. **Start the Application**:
   - In the backend:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   - In the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

After starting the application, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite) in your web browser to access the dashboard. You can:
- Add new products to the inventory.
- View current stock levels and set reorder points.
- Analyze inventory data through reports and dashboards.
