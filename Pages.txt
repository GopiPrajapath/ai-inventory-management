I'll create a Help and Support page that includes a Knowledge Base, FAQ Section, and Contact Support form. This page will provide users with resources to find answers to their questions and get assistance when needed.

Here's the React component for your Help and Support page:


This Help and Support component includes all the features you requested:

Knowledge Base:

A searchable list of articles and guides on using the software.
Articles are displayed in an accordion format for easy navigation.
FAQ Section:

A list of common issues and their solutions.
FAQs are also displayed in an accordion format and are searchable.
Contact Support:

A form for users to send messages to the support team.
Additional features:

A search bar at the top that filters both Knowledge Base articles and FAQs.
Tabs to switch between Knowledge Base, FAQ, and Contact Support sections.
Scrollable areas for Knowledge Base and FAQ sections to handle a large number of entries.
Key aspects of this component:

Responsive design using shadcn/ui components.
Consistent use of icons to visually distinguish between different sections.
Accessibility considerations, such as proper labeling and keyboard navigation.
Use of the Accordion component for expandable/collapsible content.
State management for search functionality using React hooks.
To use this component, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the shadcn/ui components and Lucide React for icons. You can add this component to your Next.js pages directory or import it into your desired layout.

In a real application, you would need to:

Replace the mock data (knowledgeBaseArticles and faqs) with actual content, possibly fetched from a CMS or database.
Implement the search functionality on the server-side for better performance with large datasets.
Add form validation and submission handling for the contact form.
Implement proper error handling and success messages for form submission.
Consider adding a live chat option for immediate support.
Possibly add a system to track and display the most frequently viewed articles or FAQs.
Is there anything specific you'd like to modify or add to this Help and Support page?
